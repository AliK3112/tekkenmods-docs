# Introduction
This article presents basic information about common resources that you see in Tekken Movesets. Bandai Namco has been using the same animation engine that they've been using since Tekken 1 but with changes built on top of it in each game. I suggest having this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DBkC-HfqD0KWQNeOTKjJWmPxdbEuCcGZxkPxQpsLkOY/edit?usp=sharing) open as you explore this article.

Huge thanks to `Sadamitsu` who explained some of the things I wasn't clear about and `Dennis` for proof-reading the documentation.

More resources will be documented in the future.

### Please Note
The structures described here are based on the latest game, *Tekken 8*. While there may be minor differences in structures across different games in the series, please note that these explanations are specifically tailored for said game. You can still get a decent idea for how Movesets work for prior games through this documentation.

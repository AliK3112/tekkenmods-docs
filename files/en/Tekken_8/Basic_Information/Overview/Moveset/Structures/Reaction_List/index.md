# Reaction List
This resource determines the reaction animations played on the opponent when an attack move connects. It defines the specific animation triggered when the attack is blocked, lands as a normal hit, strikes from different angles (front, side, or behind), or registers as a counter hit. The term "Reaction List" refers to a single instance of this resource, named as such because it contains a list of possible reaction state values.

- Each [Hit Condition](../Hit_Conditions/) item has a corresponding `Reaction List` item
- Reaction animations are all part of the same moveset that triggers an action. For example, reaction animations to King's throws are not stored in every character's moveset individually. Instead, they are stored within King's moveset and are selected and played from there.

### Consists of
- [List of Pushback for different angles/states](#list-of-pushback-for-different-anglesstates)
- [List of "Direction of Pushback" for different angles/states](#list-of-direction-of-pushback-for-different-anglesstates)
- [List of "Rotation of Pushback" for different angles/states](#list-of-rotation-of-pushback-for-different-anglesstates)
- [List of reaction move IDs for different angles/states](#list-of-reaction-move-ids-for-different-anglesstates)

### List of Pushback for different angles/states
These refer to [Pushback](../Pushback/) resource. More on them later.
  - Front
  - Back
  - Left
  - Right
  - Front (Counter Hit)
  - Downed
  - Block

### List of "Direction of Pushback" for Different Angles/States  

The path or the trajectory in which the opponent will be pushed. When an attack connects and a reaction animation is applied, the opponent's movement can be influenced diagonally. These attributes control that behavior. For example, Kazuyaâ€™s **df2 on Counter Hit** slightly pushes the opponent to his right, causing them to become slightly off-axis, this effect is achieved because the trajectory on CH is slightly diagonal.

This mini-structure consists of the following values:

- Front
- Back
- Left
- Right
- Front (Counter Hit) / Vertical Pushback for Airborne Opponents
- Downed

**Note 1:** The field responsible for *Front* pushback deals with both Hit & Block scenarios<br/>
**Note 2:** The field responsible for *Front (Counter Hit)* also determines the additional height applied to an airborne opponent when the move connects.

### List of "Rotation of Pushback" for different angles/states
These attributes determine how an opponent turns when an attack connects.

For example, when Kazuya's **df2 lands on Counter Hit**, the opponent's facing direction shifts slightly to the left of the player upon impact.  

- If an opponent completely turns around after certain attacks, it's due to these rotation values. For instance, a front-hit rotation value may be set to force a **180-degree turn**, causing the opponent to fully rotate upon being hit.

This rotation sub-structure consists of:
- Front
- Back
- Left
- Right
- Front (Counter Hit)
- Downed

### List of reaction move IDs for different angles/states

This sub-structure decides what actual move to play for the corresponding situation. They store the move indexes from the source character's moveset. It contains the following values/fields:
  - Standing / Default
  - Crouching
  - Standing (Counter Hit)
  - Crouching (Counter Hit)
  - Left Side
  - Left Side (Crouching)
  - Right Side
  - Right Side (Crouching)
  - Back Side
  - Back Side (Crouching)
  - Block
  - Block (Crouching)
  - Wall-splatted
  - Downed

## Rotation Value Calculation

To obtain the 2-byte hexadecimal value that Tekken uses for rotation in degrees, follow this straightforward calculation:
```
if      0 degrees = 0x0000
and   360 degrees = 0xFFFF
then     1 degree = 0xFFFF / 360 = 0xB6 (or 182 in decimal)

        X degrees = 0xB6 * X
```
E.g, `45 degrees` would be `0x1FFF` or `8191`

I'll just quote the exact words that `Sadamitsu` said to me when I asked him about it,

```
I think it would be easier to understand if you imagine a clock face with hexadecimal numbers. Like in the movie The Martian (2015). In this case:
0x0000 - is like 12 o'clock.
0x4000 - is like 3 o'clock.
0x8000 - is like 6 o'clock.
0xC000 - is like 9 o'clock.
```

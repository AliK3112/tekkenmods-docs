# Cancel Extra Data
These are 4-byte bit-flags that dictate additional properties for cancels. You should refer to the tab of the same name in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DBkC-HfqD0KWQNeOTKjJWmPxdbEuCcGZxkPxQpsLkOY/edit?usp=sharing). Each moveset has around 50-60 of these values. These flags can do many things at once. Some of the additional properties include
- Retaining the height for airborne moves like Clive's jumping attacks
- Retaining the frame number when transitioning from Move A to Move B
- Shaving off starting frames of the next move
- Playing the next move animation backwards
- Track to one or both side as the cancel happens
- Play both action & reaction animations on the characters (used in throws)

Some example scenarios are mentioned [here](../Cancel/#cancel---cancel-extra-data)
